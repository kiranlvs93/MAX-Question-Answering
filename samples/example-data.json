{"paragraphs": [{"context": "The choice among algorithm categories can partially be made based on the user persona's ability to intervene at different parts of a machine learning pipeline.  If the user is allowed to modify the training data, then pre-processing can be used.  If the user is allowed to change the learning algorithm, then in-processing can be used.  If the user can only treat the learned model as a black box without any ability to modify the training data or learning algorithm, then only post-processing can be used.  AIF360 recommends the earliest mediation category in the pipeline that the user has permission to apply because it gives the most flexibility and opportunity to correct bias as much as possible. If possible, all algorithms from all permissible categories should be tested because the ultimate performance depends on dataset characteristics: there is no one best algorithm independent of dataset.", "questions": ["When can preprocessing be used?"]}]}
